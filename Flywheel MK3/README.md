# MK3 Flywheel for Joe's Drive
These are the files required to move to the MK3 Flywheel for Joe's Drive. Note that you still need to get the official files from the BB-8 builder's site. You can log-in to the site, and then you'll find Joe's official release here:

https://bb8builders.club/wiki/index.php?title=BB-8_Drive_Systems

From Joe's drive, you simply omit printing the flywheel, and make sure to save the steel shot as that will be used here.

## Naming conventions
For any file that has (xN) before the extension, N is the number of times the file is required to be printed.

Files that have VN at the end, that is the internal version for the file. This is just in case over time I make updates you can know if you have an older part.

## 21700 Battery Pack
There are two options of battery packs, either the portable jump starter from Amazon, or the custom built battery pack out of six 21700 batteries. If doing the latter, you will also need to print all files in the "/21700" directory as well.

## Front and Back Balancing
The front and back balancing requires only one set depending on which way your drive is leaning. Use the procedure in the manual to determine the leaning direction, and then choose the holder for the opposite side the drive is leaning.

You will only print one set from this folder, including the body and the lids. Note the lids are made to be printed in TPU/TPC.

Please see the installation guide PDF for more details.

## Power Switch Holder
This is an optional print but one is recommended.

The Power Switch Holder Simple is just for recharge and main power. This is the most basic for those that want to save some wiring.

The Power Switch Holder Voltage is used to be able to see the voltage as well. If choosing this option, you will need to print the Voltage Display Holder as well.

See the installation guide PDF for more details.
